## 💡 Motivation
**The Problem:** Healthcare pricing is a "black box." While insurance portals show prices for individual treatments (e.g., an MRI), consumers lack tools to predict their total expected costs for the year. Existing calculators are often too generic (ignoring health conditions) or too complex (requiring specific procedure codes).

**Our Solution:** A personalized forecasting tool based on accessible inputs. Users simply enter demographic and health details such as age, insurance status, and chronic conditions to receive a cost estimate for the upcoming year. This empowers users to make data-driven decisions for FSA/HSA contributions and emergency planning.

**How It Works:** The web app is powered by a machine learning model trained on the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS), the gold standard for U.S. healthcare data. By analyzing what people with similar demographic and health profiles actually spent, our model learns real-world cost patterns and translates them into actionable financial insights without requiring complex medical records.

## 🗂️ Data
The **Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS)** is the most complete source of data on the cost and use of health care and health insurance coverage in the United States. Administered by the **Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ)**, it is a set of large-scale surveys of families and individuals, their medical providers, and employers. MEPS provides nationally representative estimates for the **U.S. civilian noninstitutionalized population**:
- **Included:** People living in households (houses, apartments) and non-institutional group quarters (e.g., college dorms).
- **Excluded:** Active-duty military, and people in institutions like nursing homes or prisons. Also excludes individual periods where a respondent moved outside the U.S. during the survey year.

**MEPS Household Component**  
The Household Component (MEPS-HC) collects comprehensive data directly from families and individuals. To ensure accuracy, household-reported expenditures are validated and imputed using the Medical Provider Component (MEPS-MPC), which draws data directly from doctors, hospitals, and pharmacies.

**MEPS-HC 2023**  
This project utilizes the 2023 Full-Year Consolidated Data File (HC-251). The data was released in August 2025.
- **Sample Size:** 18,919 individuals.
- **Variables:** 1,374.

![MEPS Data Infographic](assets/data_infographic.jpg)

**Target Variable**  
The target variable is **total out-of-pocket health care costs in 2023** (`TOTSLF23`). This variable represents what the person or their family actually paid directly for all medical events throughout 2023. It includes copays and coinsurance, deductibles, and services not covered by insurance. `TOTSLF23` directly answers practical user questions like "How much should I contribute to my FSA/HSA?" and "What's my financial exposure?" For uninsured users, out-of-pocket costs approximate total costs, making this target appropriate across all insurance statuses.

**Feature Selection**  
A subset of 26 candidate features was selected from MEPS-HC 2023 based on the following criteria:
- **Consumer Accessibility:** Users can answer from memory without looking up records, ensuring the model is usable in a consumer-facing app.
- **Beginning-of-Year Data:** To enable the app to be used during Open Enrollment for predicting *upcoming* costs, only variables measured at the beginning of the year (`31` suffix) or stable traits are used to prevent data leakage.
- **Predictive Power:** Features have established significance in healthcare cost literature.

Note: These candidate features will be further reduced based on importance scores to meet the UX goal of a form completion time of less than 90 seconds.

**Sample Weights**  
MEPS-HC 2023 includes survey sample weights (`PERWT23F`) to adjust for the complex survey design (stratification, clustering, oversampling) and non-response. This machine learning project utilizes these weights in model training to correct for the survey's intentional oversampling of specific subgroups (e.g., the elderly, low-income), preventing the model from being biased toward these groups and ensuring it learns relationships that are true for the general population.

## ⚙️ Getting Started

### Virtual Environments
This project uses two isolated environments to keep application dependencies lightweight for production deployment.

**Training Environment** (`.venv-train`)
- **Requirements File:** `requirements-train.txt`
- **Purpose:** Model development (preprocessing, EDA, training, evaluation, tuning, selection)
- **Key Libraries:** `jupyterlab`, `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `scikit-learn`

**Application Environment** (`.venv-app`)
- **Requirements Files:** 
    - `requirements.txt`: Web application dependencies for production deployment (used by deployment platforms)
    - `requirements-test.txt`: Inherits from `requirements.txt` and adds `pytest` for local testing
- **Purpose:** Run and test the web application 
- **Key Libraries:** `fastapi`, `gradio`, `scikit-learn`

**Note:** Both environments use the same version of `scikit-learn` to ensure model consistency across training and deployment.
